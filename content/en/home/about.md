Hi, I'm Julien Crouzet, I'm a french developer, mainly fullstack, my favourite sujects are :

- Go
- C
- React
- Video streaming, and all about medias tech

This website can talk about other subjects, if I want to.

A blog or a personal website can a very time-consuming activity to be maintained, I'll try
to update it as often as possible, but no warranty, of course.

Please share it if you can/want, it'll probably help me to get motivated.

English is not my first language, content may, erm, will contain a lot of typos and errors, don't
hesitate to make pull requests if you want.
